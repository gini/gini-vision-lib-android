Gini Vision Library for Android
===============================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini Vision Library for Android provides functionality to capture documents with mobile phones.
The captured images can be reviewed and rotated to the correct orientation by the user and are optimized on the device
to provide the best results when used with the Gini API.
